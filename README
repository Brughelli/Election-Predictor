CSCI 4830 Final Project

My project requires that NLTK is installed with the wordnet corpora and 
the moviereviews corpora downloaded.  It also requires that TextBlob
is installed with all Textblob corpora installed.

To install NLTK: (Unix Instructions)

	i.) Must download and install Setuptools -> https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#unix-wget
   ii.) Install Pip: run 'sudo easy_install pip'
  iii.) Install Numpy: run 'sudo pip install -U numpy'
   iv.) Install NLTK: run 'sudo pip install -U nltk'
    v.) Test installation: run 'python' then type 'import nltk'
   
To download NLTK corpora:
	
	i.) Run 'python' then type 'import nltk' followed by nltk.download()
   ii.) A window will open showing the nltk downloader
  iii.) Click on the File menu and select Change Download Directory to /usr/share/nltk_data
   iv.) Select the wordnet and moviereviews corpora and donwload them

To install TextBlob + TextBlob corpora:

	i.) Type 'pip install -U textblob'
   ii.) Type 'python -m textblob.download_corpora'

To Run my py files:
	
	i.) Extract the entire contents of the Michael_Brughelli_4830_FINAL.zip file into a 
		SINGLE directory
   ii.)	Type 'python Classifier.py'
  iii.) When prompted, choose between the 3 available training, testing, and marked data sets
   iv.) Wait for the magical political race predictor to print the prediction and be amazed
		on election day when it is correct!!
